    "# Diversity  \n",
    "Diversity in ecological studies refers to different aspects of variation within and across communities:  \n",
    "- **Alpha diversity:** The richness and evenness of taxa (or \"features\") within a single sample or site. It measures how many different taxa are present and how evenly they are distributed.\n",
    "- **Beta diversity:** The degree of difference in community composition between two or more samples. It captures how similar or dissimilar communities are across environments.\n",
    "- **Gamma diversity:** The overall diversity across a collection of samples or an entire region, considering both the number of taxa and their distribution at a broader spatial scale.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Naive-, phylogenetic-, or functional diversity**  \n",
    "One way to calculate diversity is to consider all taxa as separate entities and not care about their relationships. We call these diversity values *naive*.  \n",
    "A second way to calculate diversity takes the relationships in a phylogenetic tree into account. Two taxa that share many branches in the tree contribute less to diversity than two that are very far from each other in the tree. We call the diversity values that are calculated with a tree as input *phylogenetic*.  \n",
    "A third way to calculate diversity takes the pairwise distances between taxa into account. Two taxa that have a small pairwise distance contribute less to diversity than two that have a high pairwise distance. We call the diversity values that are calculated with a distance matrix as input *functional*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive alpha diversity is simply the effective number of taxa, phylogenetic alpha diversity is the effective branch diversity in the phylogenetic tree associated with the taxa in the sample, and functional alpha diversity is the effective total distance between taxa in the sample. The word \"effective\" used above refers to the relative abundance weighting by the diversity order, q.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hill numbers (or effective numbers)**  \n",
    "Imagine a community with 10 species, all equally abundant. The most intuitive measure of diversity here is 10, and Hill numbers give exactly that result. Now consider a community with 2 dominant species and 8 rare ones. What should the diversity be?  \n",
    "- If we ignore relative abundances, the answer is 10.\n",
    "- If we ignore rare species, the answer is 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hill numbers solve this by introducing a single parameter, the diversity order (q), which controls how much weight is given to species’ relative abundances:  \n",
    "- When q=0, all species count equally (richness).\n",
    "- When q=1, species are weighted by their proportional abundance (Shannon diversity).\n",
    "- When q=2, common species dominate the measure (Simpson diversity).\n",
    "\n",
    "This flexibility makes Hill numbers a powerful and intuitive framework for comparing communities. And it doesn’t stop at 0, 1, or 2 — diversity can be explored across a continuum of q values, offering a nuanced view of community structure."
