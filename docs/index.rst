Welcome to qdiv's documentation!
================================
qdiv is a Python package for analyzing results from rRNA gene amplicon sequencing or similar data.

With qdiv you can subset and rarefy the data, generate a consensus table based on several count tables, 
calculate alpha- and beta diversity indices (focusing on Hill-based indices), 
plot a heatmap or PCoA, carry out null model analysis (Raup-Crick, NRI, NTI, beta NRI, and beta NTI, extended to all possible diversity orders), 
and run the Mantel- and Permanova tests.

Several scientific papers have been studied to program the algorithms used in qdiv. The key references can be found under Citations.
